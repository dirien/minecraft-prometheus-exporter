This is a Prometheus Minecraft exporter, created as part of the [minectl üó∫](https://github.com/dirien/minectl) project.

It collects metrics from different sources of the game

- RCON
- NBT Files
- Advancement file
- Player stats file

#### RCON

RCON is a protocol that can be used to remotely execute commands to your Minecraft server.

To enable rcon on your minecraft server add the following to the `properties` field in your `minectl` manifest:

```yaml
    ...
    edition: java
    properties: |
      broadcast-rcon-to-ops=false
      rcon.port=25575
      rcon.password=<your password>
      enable-rcon=true
    ...
```

See [server config examples](https://github.com/dirien/minectl#server-config-) for details and usage of the minectl üó∫
manifest file.

Alternatively you need to edit your server.properties on your server.

Be sure that following flags are set for the `minecraft-prometheus-exporter` binary:

```bash
--mc.rcon-address=":25575"  
--mc.rcon-password=<rcon-password>
```

#### Files

To access the files, take care that the `minecraft-prometheus-exporter` binary is started with the flag

Details for the specific stats can be found here -> https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Statistics

```bash
--mc.world=path/to/world
```
