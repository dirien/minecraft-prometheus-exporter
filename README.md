This is a Prometheus Minecraft exporter, created as part of the [minectl üó∫](https://github.com/dirien/minectl) project.

It collects metrics from different sources of the game

- RCON
- NBT Files
- Advancement file
- Player stats file

#### RCON

RCON is a protocol that can be used to remotely execute commands to your Minecraft server.

To enable rcon on your minecraft server add the following to the `java` field in your `minectl` manifest:

```yaml
    ...
    java:
      xmx: 2G
      xms: 2G
      rcon:
        password: test
        port: 25575
        enabled: true
        broadcast: true
    edition: java
    ...
```

See [server config examples](https://github.com/dirien/minectl#server-config-) for details and usage of the minectl üó∫
manifest file.

Alternatively you need to edit your server.properties on your server.

Be sure that following flags are set for the `minecraft-exporter` binary:

```bash
--mc.rcon-address=":25575"  
--mc.rcon-password=<rcon-password>
```

#### Files

To access the files, take care that the `minecraft-exporter` binary is started with the flag

Details for the specific stats can be found here -> https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Statistics

```bash
--mc.world=path/to/world
```

#### Disabling metrics

To disable certain metrics, just add corresponding key to `disabled-metrics` section with `true` value in your config file.
You should use keys that used by Minecraft to store players' stats.

#### Example config

```yaml
disabled-metrics:
  minecraft:mined: true # Disable "minecraft_blocks_mined_total" metric
  minecraft:creeper: true # Disable all metrics related with creepers
  minecraft:custom: false # "false" values will be ignored, so this line does nothing
listen-address: ':9151' # Change address of web server. "--web.listen-address" will be ignored if this line is present here
```
